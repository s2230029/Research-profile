   # Ammazia Hanif

  Welcome!
  I am currently working as a JSPS Special Research Fellow at the Hitotsubashi University, in Tokyo, Japan. My research focuses on health economics, development economics, 
  and partly environmental economics, with a particular interest in the health outcomes of WASH, womenâ€™s well-being, and child health in developing countries. My current 
  research projects focus on the health of the women and children in Pakistan, Cambodia, Madagascar, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

  I received my Ph.D. in International Public Policy from University of Tsukuba in Japan.
